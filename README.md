# umma_car_parking_management_system
Umma car parking management system is used to manage the operation and task that are carried out in a car park. Tracking all the process flows and tracing all the revenue that is generated at the car park. This increases accountability, transparency and reduces the chances of fraud.
The current system that is in place is completely manual and involves parking attendants issuing receipts to park users and this has had a lot of inefficiencies whereby the attendants are overwhelmed by the number of clients that they can be able to serve at a particular time.
Some people can be opportunistic and get away without paying for the services while others collude with the attendant for subsidized rates 
Cash collected in the current system is on cash Basis and leading to adverse effects in terms of corruption and money laundering 
The system provides a capability whereby parking users can be able to pay for their services by use of internet enabled mobile phones. The parking uses will have accounts with which they will be updating their information as well as booking services. The users can also reload a float balance in his/her account in order to be able to use the parking 
The system should also provide a feature to enable the administrators or the system user to know the booked spaces, to know the available spaces and to provides the total amount generated at a specific time specified by the user.
